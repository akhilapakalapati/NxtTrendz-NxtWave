I have developed the frontend part of the Nxt Trendz online shopping application, which is similar to Amazon. I developed it using React in a week. My primary focus was on building the frontend part of the application. This application allows users to log in, search, sort, filter, select products, and add them to the shopping cart.
The learning objective of this project was to apply concepts such as authentication, state management, context, page navigation, media queries and flexbox in the code by following the clean code guidelines.

I implemented a basic authentication flow and handled common errors such as invalid username and invalid password. I used cookies to persist user credentials across page reloads.

I used Context for state management for creating a global state to manage cart state across routes. I used React Router for navigation within the application. Additionally, I implemented protected routes to control access based on user roles.
Since my major focus was building the frontend part of the application, I integrated mock APIs for displaying data.

I followed clean code guidelines by maintaining a consistent folder structure and used meaningful naming conventions, such as prefixing event handlers with on and creating reusable components throughout the application.

To ensure a responsive design, I used media queries and flexbox for layouting.

I have planned to develop a backend using Node.js and Express.js to replace the mock API implementation. This will also allow me to have more control over the data and offer more features like user profiles and product recommendations. Additionally, I will be implementing separate APIs for sellers and buyers to facilitate their interactions with the platform. The seller API will enable sellers to manage their product listings, inventory, orders, and sales analytics, while the buyer API will provide functionalities for browsing products, adding them to cart, making purchases, and viewing order history. Developing these APIs will enhance the platform's functionality and provide a seamless experience for both sellers and buyers, fostering growth and user satisfaction.
